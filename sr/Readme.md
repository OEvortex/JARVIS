> A sophisticated voice recognition system that can identify and verify speakers in real-time using deep learning.

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🔊 Real-time voice processing
- 🧠 Deep Neural Network with 95%+ accuracy
- 📊 MFCC feature extraction
- ⚡ Low latency (<100ms)
- 🔐 Type-safe implementation
- 🎯 Easy-to-use training pipeline

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/OE-LUCIFER/voice-recognition-system.git

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd sr
# Create data directories
mkdir -p data/my_voice data/other_voice
cd..
# Run the system
python main.py
```

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Working microphone
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## 🎓 How It Works

1. **Audio Capture**

   - 3-second audio segments
   - 22050Hz sample rate

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - MFCC feature computation
   - 40 cepstral coefficients
   - Real-time processing

3. **Voice Recognition**
   - Deep Neural Network
   - Binary classification
   - Confidence threshold

## 🛠️ Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:
```python
SAMPLE_RATE = 22050  # Audio quality
DURATION = 3         # Recording window
N_MFCC = 40         # Feature count
```

## 📊 Training Data Requirements

1. **Your Voice**
   - 20+ samples in `data/my_voice/`
   - 3 seconds each
   - Clear speech

2. **Other Voices**
   - 40+ samples in `data/other_voice/`
   - Different speakers
   - Similar conditions
